## Overview
**OpenPrivML** is a project to develop a robust open-source ecosystem for privacy-preserving ML. Our goal is to reconcile the tension between high-security requirements and the performance demands of modern deep learning pipelines. Through a blend of **homomorphic encryption**, **secure multiparty computation**, and targeted **model compression and pipelining** strategies, we aim to enable near real-time processing of confidential data across healthcare, finance, and other sensitive domains.

## Key Features
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computations directly on encrypted data for secure inference.
- **Secure Multiparty Computation**: Distributes computation among multiple parties to maintain privacy.
- **Model Compression & Optimization**: Uses advanced pruning, layer consolidation, and pipelining to reduce latency.
- **Modular Design**: Easy integration with popular ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and cryptographic backends.
- **Community-Driven**: Encourages external contributions, domain-specific optimizations, and transparent governance.

## Architecture
OpenPrivML adopts a **layered architecture**:
1. **Core Crypto Layer**: Implements homomorphic encryption, secure MPC, and other cryptographic primitives.
2. **ML Integration Layer**: Bridges between standard ML frameworks and our crypto layer, handling encryption/decryption workflows.
3. **Optimization Layer**: Provides compression, pipelining, and caching strategies for efficient computation on resource-limited devices.
4. **Application Layer**: Contains example applications, demos, and domain-specific integrations (e.g., healthcare, finance).
